# Terms of Service

Last updated: February 23, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of this website and related services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Who We Are

This Service is operated by **${BUSINESS_NAME}** ("we," "us," or "our").

- Contact email: **${SUPPORT_EMAIL}**
- Business address: **${BUSINESS_ADDRESS}**

## 2. Eligibility and Account Access

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service.

If you sign in using Google OAuth:

- You authorize us to receive profile data you consent to share (for example: name, email, profile picture).
- You are responsible for activity that occurs under your account.
- You must notify us promptly of unauthorized use.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Violate any applicable law or regulation.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or data.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service (including abuse, scraping, or introducing malicious code).
- Misrepresent your identity or affiliation.

We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms.

## 4. Privacy

Your use of the Service is also subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how personal data is handled.

## 5. Intellectual Property

Unless otherwise stated, the Service and its content are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

You may use the Service only as permitted by these Terms.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Service may rely on third-party services (such as Google OAuth). We are not responsible for third-party websites, services, or their terms and policies.

## 7. Disclaimers

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of the Service.

Where liability cannot be excluded, our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us for the Service in the 12 months before the claim, or USD $100, whichever is greater.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 10. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without notice, for legitimate business, legal, or security reasons.

Sections that by their nature should survive termination (for example, limitation of liability and indemnification) will survive.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **${BUSINESS_COUNTRY}**, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

Any disputes will be resolved in the courts located in **${BUSINESS_CITY}**, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

## 12. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms and revise the "Last updated" date.

Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.

## 13. Contact

Questions about these Terms can be sent to:

- Email: **${SUPPORT_EMAIL}**
- Address: **${BUSINESS_ADDRESS}**
